MadelbulbGPU
============

MadelbulbGPU is a small and simple demo written in OpenCL. It is based on
Keenan Crane's qjulia available at http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~keenan/project_qjulia.html.
The idea of Ambient Occlusion and Mandelbulb comes from Tom Beddard's
http://www.subblue.com and Enforcer's http://www.fractalforums.com/mandelbulb-implementation/realtime-renderingoptimisations/.
MadelbulbGPU has been written using the ATI OpenCL SDK 2.0 on Linux but it
should work on any platform/implementation (i.e. NVIDIA).
